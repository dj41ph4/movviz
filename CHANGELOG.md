## v1.12.75 — August 2026

### Root cause of a completed season-pack download that never showed up in the library

- **Fixed, confirmed live**: investigated a specific case (an anime whose season packs had fully downloaded — the queue showed them "completed" — but none of the episodes ever became available). The root cause: some season-pack releases name their episode files after the show in a heavily abbreviated or non-standard form the title parser can't recognize (in the confirmed case, an acronym sharing no words with the real title) — so when the completed download's files failed to match any tracked episode, they were correctly *not* deleted, but the recovery pass that's supposed to catch exactly this case only recorded the miss in a value nothing ever read, so the files sat there indefinitely with zero visibility.
- The recovery pass now records these the same way a truly-unlinked manual download already does: they show up in Activité → Non liés, where they can be manually pointed at the right title — generically, for any release whose name the parser can't confidently map, not specific to the one show that surfaced it.

## v1.12.74 — August 2026

### Matching bug that could grab the wrong show, and a job-queue stall that could silently freeze all background searches

- **Fixed, confirmed live**: the title-matching score treated two titles as near-identical based on raw character distance alone, even when they differed by one completely different word — confirmed live with "How I Met Your Father" (an unrelated spin-off) scoring ~91% similar to a search for "How I Met Your Mother" and getting grabbed in its place. The scorer now also checks word-by-word: a wholesale different word (not a spelling variant) is disqualifying regardless of how close the overall character count looks.
- **Fixed, confirmed live**: a single stuck background task (in this case a slow Plex sync) could occupy a job-queue slot indefinitely, silently blocking every other queued job behind it — including scheduled and manual searches — for as long as it stayed stuck, with no error or indication anything was wrong. This is what could leave a monitored, correctly-added title never actually searched. The queue now frees a job's slot after 10 minutes if it hasn't finished, so a single hung task can no longer starve everything behind it.

## v1.12.73 — August 2026

### Beta player — direct play now starts the way the manual "lightning bolt" retry always worked

- **Fixed**: the player used to decide whether to attempt direct play by pre-checking codec support with browser APIs that are known to lie for common cases (AC-3/E-AC-3 always reporting "unsupported" on Chrome/Edge, some containers reporting decodable video as unsupported) — routing many files to a transcode or WebCodecs fallback that direct play would actually have handled fine. Confirmed live: the manual retry button, which always attempted direct unconditionally with no such pre-check, worked noticeably better.
- Direct play is now the unconditional first attempt on every video, exactly matching what the manual retry already did — the two are now literally the same code path, sharing the same automatic recovery (falls back to the other playback mode on a real playback error or on genuinely silent audio, unchanged from before).
- The manual retry button now benefits from that same automatic recovery too, and resumes from the current position instead of restarting from zero.
- Removed the now-fully-unused WebCodecs playback path this pre-check used to route into — it was strictly a worse, redundant version of what direct play + the existing fallback chain already cover.

## v1.12.72 — August 2026

### Theater Mode — a real immersive player, not a video in a modal

- **New**: the Beta player now opens in a full "Theater Mode" — the current page stays exactly where it was behind it (scroll position, state, everything), the player expands from the button you clicked with a genuine geometric transition (not a fade), and the page behind dims and blurs progressively rather than just disappearing.
- Any ambient trailer or preview playing anywhere on screen stops the instant the real player opens — never two videos playing at once.
- The player's backdrop now takes on a subtle color ambience extracted from the title's own artwork (dominant tones, brightness-aware) instead of being flat black — analyzed once per title and cached, never during playback.
- "Lire dans Plex" now reads "Lire" wherever the Beta player will actually handle playback, and stays "Lire sur Plex" wherever it's a genuine hand-off to Plex — consistent across every title card, the title page, the episode page, and the dashboard hero (which previously had no Beta player integration at all).
- The three separate copies of this trigger logic across the app are now one shared implementation, closing the gap where a future fix could land in one place and be missed in the others.

### In-app "what's new" now follows your interface language

- Release notes are now localized per UI language (falling back to English for anything not yet translated), instead of a single fixed-language file.
- **Fixed**: the release notes were silently missing on both the Docker and Windows builds — the file they're read from was never actually included in either packaged build, so the "what's new" popup had nothing to show.

## v1.12.70 — August 2026

### Download engine — root cause of permanently unlinked downloads

- **Fixed, confirmed live**: removing a torrent from the download engine reported success and wiped its own tracking (including which library title it belonged to) even when the underlying download client silently failed to actually remove it — the torrent kept running and seeding untouched, but the engine had no record of it anymore. This is what produced downloads that could never be linked back to a title no matter how many times a recovery scan ran. The engine now only clears its own bookkeeping once removal is independently confirmed; otherwise the torrent stays tracked and can be retried instead of turning into a permanent orphan.

## v1.12.51 – v1.12.69 — August 2026

Matching accuracy and engine reliability pass: complete-series pack detection (season-range terms, false-positive guards), stuck-download recovery hardened to atomic no-overwrite moves with a reliable import callback, per-series/movie write locking to close a race that could drop a completed episode's status, and duplicate-download reconciliation so a re-grabbed file no longer leaves the library stuck on the wrong status. User guide refreshed to cover recently shipped features (title editing, movie versions, unlinked-download linking, anime settings).

## v1.12.24 – v1.12.50 — August 2026

Complete-series pack search (single-query, season-range aware), download recovery reliability (folder scan, orphaned-file matching, duplicate cleanup), secured duplicate deletion, and a small automated test suite for the release-matching core.

## v1.10.90 – v1.12.23 — July–August 2026

Quality-upgrade workflow (Optimize / Ignore, meaningful-upgrade detection), a redesigned resolution/codec badge system, GPU/animation performance profiles, and engine stabilization across the interchangeable download backends (crash fixes, anti-stall rule, per-series search locking).

## v1.10.39 – v1.10.89 — July 2026

Download engine rewrite with interchangeable backends (native/aria2, WebTorrent, libtorrent), a maintenance "recover downloads" tool for orphaned files, a premium toast notification system, audio-codec badges, and beta in-app playback improvements (direct play, transcode logging).

## v1.10.12 – v1.10.17 — July 2026

Language-detection accuracy pass: audio-track language read from Plex, French-variant tags (VF/VFQ/VFF/TRUEFRENCH) correctly satisfying quality profiles, duplicate-episode cleanup, and a fix for premature torrent abandonment.

## v1.10.1 – v1.10.6 — July 2026

Decision Guard (pre-grab blocklist enforcement), franchise/collection detection, a redesigned download queue and diagnostics dashboard, and trailer/calendar refinements.

## v1.8.0 – v1.9.9 — July 2026

Unified title panel (single component for the slide-in and full-page views), a trash/recycle-bin safety net for removed titles, mobile responsiveness pass, and a fix for a memory leak in the metadata cache.

## v1.4.5 – v1.7.9 — July 2026

Security hardening (path traversal, database protections, CodeQL alerts), the trash system's final protections, a live in-app player, real-time updates across the UI, Plex activity monitoring, and collections support.

## v1.1.67 – v1.4.4 — July 2026

In-app player with automatic Plex transcode fallback, Overseerr (Seerr) request import, multi-architecture Docker builds, and a reduction of the settings navigation from 26 tabs down to 18.

## v1.1.50 – v1.1.66 — July 2026

Initial public release: TMDb discovery, Torznab/Newznab indexer search, unified movie/series library, multi-user requests, the built-in BitTorrent engine, and Plex sync — plus early stability and security fixes (session handling, library deduplication, dependency upgrades).
